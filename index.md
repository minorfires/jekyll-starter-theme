What's Markdown (`.md`)?

Markdown is markup that lets you write hypertext (HTML) documents
in easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text.
No angle brackets `<></>` required for
paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, etc.


This is a paragraph (in Markdown). Some more
text here.

This is another paragraph. Actually, it's just a sentence. A life sentence. Now we're getting closer to being a paragraph.

This is a list:

- Orange
- Apple
- Blueberry
